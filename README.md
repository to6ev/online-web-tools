Read pls ...

Not all PHP scripts are mine! But they are free too.

I use many free APIs for this project and you need get own KEY from websites. Just read my comments in src. 

How to Install? 
- Nothing to install! Just Copy&Paste all dirs/folders into your localhost/www or to any free webhosting via free FTP client (like bareFTP, FileZilla, cuteFTP, gFTP, net2ftp etc.)
The files are too many and upload process will be long :) Don't select all files/folders when you upload them to remote webserver! Just divide into parts all these files. Some webhosting have protection from malicious codes/scripts/files and maybe will detect some of the scripts like dangerouse, and will suspend your free account :) On paid hostings - no problems :)

Some dirs/folders need writable permission! chmod 755 or 777 :) 
Right click with the mouse on Folders and:
Properties->Permissions: Owner: Access: Read and write ... Group: Access: Read and write ... or from Terminal with commands ...
Give writable permission to all folders :) and don't worry nobody will cracking your website :)
Read tuts about chmod ... it's not so difficult ...

It is not good idea to work under Windows OS with PHP :) If you want to be free and to feel the Power of PHP and webservers, then I suggest you to use FreeBSD OS, any distro of Linux OS.

You can use my free webhosting service www.f1.al to test the scripts. Not all function well :) Use old versions of PHP and not PHP7 ... Just use v5.3 or v5.6 ... in cPanel you able to change php versions... 

See this tut: http://askubuntu.com/questions/761713/how-can-i-downgrade-from-php-7-to-php-5-6-on-ubuntu-16-04
If you want to test on local webserver and how to change the versions of PHP.

Feel free to send me email for anything:  http://tools.eti.pw/contact.php
